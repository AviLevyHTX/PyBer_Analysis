# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

PyBer is a ride sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion and therefore requires detailed analysis and reports to understand how the business is performing. There are many metrics to study however the CEO, V. Isualize, has requested an analysis of the ride sharing data by city type and an analysis of total weekly fares for each city type. The analysis of the ride sharing data by city type will provide valuable information about the app's performance in three different city types and will include the ridership performance, fare performance, and driver count in those cities. The analysis of total weekly fares for each city type will contain a visual tool in the form of a graph to help understand the trend over short time frame in the year 2019. V.Isualize is a detail oriented person so the analysis that will be performed will be thorough and help PyBer continue to succeed amongst other ride sharing apps.
