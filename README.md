# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

PyBer is a ride sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion and therefore requires detailed analysis and reports to understand how the business is performing. There are many metrics to study however the CEO, V. Isualize, has requested an analysis of the ride sharing data by city type and an analysis of total weekly fares for each city type. The analysis of the ride sharing data by city type will provide valuable information about the app's performance in three different city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) and will include the ridership performance, fare performance, and driver count in those cities. The analysis of total weekly fares for each city type will contain a visual tool in the form of a graph to help understand the trend over short time frame in the year 2019. There is important information by comparuing the different city types. V.Isualize is a detail oriented person so the analysis that will be performed will be thorough and help PyBer continue to succeed amongst other ride sharing apps.  

## Results
### Analysis of Ride Sharing Data by City Type
In each of the three city types, calculations were performed to obtain the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. All that information was collected and placed in the table below (also can be found in Analysis folder and table is referred to as Fig9).

Based on the collected data, urban cities had the highest total rides with a total of 1,625 rides, while there were 625 total rides for suburban cities, and 125 total rides for rural cities. Urban cities also had the highest number of total drivers, with 2,405 drivers, and also had the highest total fares, with $39,854.38. Following urban cities, suburban cities had the second highest total drivers, with 490 drivers, and second highest total fares, with $19,356.33. Rural cities had the lowest out of the three city types with 78 total drivers and total fares equaled $4,327.98. 

While urban cities were highest for the metrics listed above, rural cities had the highest average fare per ride- $34.62, followed by suburban cities- $30.97, and then lowest was urban cities- $24.53. Rural cities also had the highest average fare per driver, which was $55.49, followed by suburban cities, which was $39.50, and lowest again was urban cities, which was $16.57. 

When reviewing the data about urban cities, the average fare per ride was higher than the average fare per driver. This may indicate that drivers working in urban cities must operate at a lost because the average amount they earn is less than the average fare per ride.

### Analysis of Total Weekly Fares for Each City Type
Another analysis was performed to understand and visualize how fares compared amongst the three city types. The analysis involved a time period of four months between January and April in 2019. A multiple line chart was then created, which can be seen below, to visualize the fare trends throughout that time period.

From the multiple line chart, urban cities maintained the highest sum of fares in each week reaching a peak of $2,500 once in late February and another time in early March. Then that was followed by suburban cities, and the lowest total fares were in rural cities. It also appears that although urban cities had the highest total fares,  the fares in urban cities were more volatile as indicated by the greater number of peaks and troughs in the line graph for urban cities around the month of March. The fluctuation could be caused by various factors but the urban city fares still managed to remain highest amongst all the city types. 

The other cities did appear to have some fluctuations but rural city fares seem to remain relatively stable since the peaks did not seem as extreme as with urban cities. Fares in suburban cities had an extreme peak in late Februrary but the fares in suburban cities still apear more consistent than urban cities. 

## Summary
The analyses revealed great information for V. Isualize to review and help PyBer employees make data based decisions to help grow the company. Urban cities were shown to have the most rides, most drivers, and most toal fares; however it had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, which may indicate that drivers have to opperate at a loss. On the other hand, rural cities had the lowest rides, lowest amount of drivers, and lowest total fares; however rural cities had the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver so both the company and drivers are making more money in rural cities. Suburban cities fell in the middle between urban and rural cities. 

Between January and April of 2019, urban cities were shown to have the highest weekly fares, though also seemed to have the most fluctuation in fare prices. Second highest was surburban cities and lowest weekly fares were in rural cities. 

The data collected helps show how the three city types operate with a large dataset over a long period of time, but the other analysis shows how the city types operate on a shorter, weekly timeline. Both can help V. Isualize and her team make appropriate business decisions. 

One possible business recommendation is to reduce the number of urban drivers. That will help increase the average fare per driver and overall could help reduce overhead employee costs. 
Another business recommendation is to hire more rural drivers and advertise more in those cities since the average fare per ride and average fare per driver was the highest in rural cities. Although hiring more drivers may reduce the average fare per driver, there is enough room to grow when comparing that to the average fare per driver in urban cities. Perhaps the drivers in urban cities could be encouraged to perform more rides in rural cities. 
A third business recommendation is have higher fares in urban cities. There are enough rides in urban cities where a small increase will help raise the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. If the average fare per driver is not raised in urban cities then eventually urban city drivers will loose to much money and have to find other jobs. And if they don't quit then customer service could be negatively impacted if the drivers are not happy where they work. 

The detailed analysis and data based business recommendations will help V. Isualize and PyBer continue to be successful and grow the company.
